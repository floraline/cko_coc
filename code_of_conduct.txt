                     CKO Code of Conduct

To help provide a safe and fun environment for everyone, please read this
document and follow all rules while connected to this public DCSS server.

Users that are found to be in violation of these rules may have their account
suspended at any time, with no warning.


1. Be courteous to other players. Harassment will not be tolerated.

2. Don't use obscene account or clan names.

3. Don't use account names, clan names, or chat messages to send spam or
   advertisements for unrelated content. Advertising your Dungeon Crawl content
   is okay.

4. Do not attempt to steal or break into user accounts that don't belong to
   you.

5. Abuse of the system is not acceptable. This includes everything from
   denial-of-service attacks to sending spam or advertisements. Running chat
   bots is also not permitted without prior consent from an administrator.
   These actions can degrade the online experience for other players.


This code of conduct was written in good faith to preserve a fun atmosphere
and a functioning server environment, so that all players can enjoy the game.
